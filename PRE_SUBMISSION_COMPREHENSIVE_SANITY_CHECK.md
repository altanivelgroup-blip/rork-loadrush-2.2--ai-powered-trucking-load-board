## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES & NON-CRITICAL ITEMS

### 1. Request Aborted Warnings
**Severity: LOW - Non-Breaking**
```
[useDriverRoute] Fetch error: Request aborted
```

- **Impact:** None - handled gracefully with retry logic
- **Fix:** Already implemented - logged as info, not error
- **Status:** Safe to ignore

### 2. Google Maps API Key Missing
**Severity: MEDIUM - Feature Incomplete**
- **Impact:** Map view on iPad/web won't load (falls back to dark mode)
- **Fix Required:** Add `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` to `.env`
- **Fallback:** Dark mode visualization works without key
- **Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES ATTENTION BEFORE FULL DEPLOYMENT

### 3. Console Logs Verbose
**Severity: LOW - Cosmetic**
- **Impact:** None - helpful for debugging
- **Action:** Can be reduced for production if desired
- **Status:** Optional cleanup
