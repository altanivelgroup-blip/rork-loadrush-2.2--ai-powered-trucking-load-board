# tRPC Fetch Error Fix - Verification Guide

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Automatic Retry Logic**
- Added 3-attempt retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Retries on network errors, timeouts, and failed responses
- Smart retry delays: 1s, 2s, 3s

### 2. **Firebase Auth Token Integration**
- tRPC client now automatically includes Firebase auth tokens
- Backend receives and validates auth tokens
- Secure communication between client and server

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Better error messages for different failure types
- Graceful degradation when backend is unavailable
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 4. **Backend Improvements**
- Added retry logic in routing API calls
- Better error formatting and logging
- Context now includes auth token

## üîß Files Modified

1. **lib/trpc.ts** - Added retry logic and auth token handling
2. **hooks/useDriverRoute.ts** - Enhanced error handling with retries
3. **backend/trpc/create-context.ts** - Added auth token extraction
4. **backend/trpc/routes/routing/get-route/route.ts** - Added retry logic for ORS API

## ‚úÖ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Verify Backend is Running
```bash
# Check if backend is accessible
curl http://localhost:8081/api

# Expected response: {"status":"ok","message":"API is running"}
```

### Step 2: Test on Web (iPad/Desktop)
1. Open browser to your app
2. Sign in as admin: `admin@loadrush.com`
3. Navigate to Command Center
4. Open browser console (F12)
5. Look for these logs:
   ```
   ‚úÖ [getRouteProcedure] Route calculated successfully
   ‚úÖ [useDriverRoute] Route fetched successfully
   ```

### Step 3: Test Error Recovery
1. Stop the backend server
2. Refresh Command Center
3. You should see retry attempts in console:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è tRPC fetch error (attempt 1/3)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è tRPC fetch error (attempt 2/3)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è tRPC fetch error (attempt 3/3)
   ```
4. Restart backend
5. Routes should load automatically

### Step 4: Verify Driver Simulation
1. In Command Center, ensure:
   - All drivers are visible on map
   - Lights are blinking (pulsing animation)
   - Cities match driver locations
   - No fetch errors in console

### Step 5: Test Projector Mode
1. Toggle "Projector Mode" switch
2. Verify driver cycling works
3. Check that route data loads for each driver
4. No errors should appear

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" errors
**Solution:**
- Ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:8081`
- Check `.env` file has correct `EXPO_PUBLIC_RORK_API_BASE_URL`
- Verify no firewall blocking localhost connections

### Issue: "TRPCClientError" in console
**Solution:**
- Backend might not be running
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify ORS API key is valid in `.env`

### Issue: Routes not loading
**Solution:**
- Check ORS API key: `EXPO_PUBLIC_ORS_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Verify driver has valid pickup/dropoff locations
- Check browser console for specific error messages

### Issue: Auth token warnings
**Solution:**
- Sign out and sign back in
- Clear browser cache
- Verify Firebase config is correct

## üìä Expected Console Output (Success)

```
üîê [signIn] Sign in successful as: admin
‚úÖ [onAuthStateChanged] Setting user with role: admin
[getRouteProcedure] Request received: { origin: "32.7767, -96.7970", destination: "29.7604, -95.3698", hasAuth: true }
[getRouteProcedure] Calling ORS API (attempt 1/3)...
[getRouteProcedure] Route calculated successfully: { points: 245, distance: "239.4 mi", duration: "3 h 42 m" }
[useDriverRoute] Route fetched successfully { points: 245, distance: "239.4 mi", duration: "3 h 42 m" }
```

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

- **Retry Logic**: Automatic recovery from transient failures
- **Auth Tokens**: Secure API calls with Firebase authentication
- **Better Errors**: Clear messages help identify issues quickly
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging

## üîç Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backend running on localhost:8081
- [ ] No "Failed to fetch" errors after sign-in
- [ ] Routes load successfully in Command Center
- [ ] Driver cards show ETA and distance
- [ ] Projector mode cycles through drivers
- [ ] All driver lights blinking on map
- [ ] Cities match driver locations
- [ ] No TRPCClientError in console
- [ ] Retry logic works when backend restarts
- [ ] Auth tokens included in requests

## üìù Next Steps

If all tests pass:
1. ‚úÖ tRPC is working correctly
2. ‚úÖ Routes load without errors
3. ‚úÖ Simulation runs smoothly
4. ‚úÖ Ready for production testing

If issues persist:
1. Check backend logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test with different drivers
4. Check network tab in browser DevTools

## üéâ Success Criteria

Your app is working correctly when:
- Sign-in completes without errors
- Command Center loads all drivers
- Route data appears in driver cards
- No fetch errors in console
- Simulation runs smoothly
- Projector mode works without issues
