## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Firebase Connection Issues
- Check that you've replaced the placeholder config in `config/firebase.ts`
- Verify Firebase Authentication is enabled
- Ensure Firestore and Storage are created

### App Not Loading
- Clear cache: `bunx expo start --clear`
- Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && bun install`
- Check that you're on the same WiFi network (mobile testing)

### TypeScript Errors
- Run `bun run tsc` to check for type errors
- All dummy data is fully typed - use as reference

---

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start with Web Preview**: Fastest way to test UI changes
2. **Use Dummy Data**: Pre-loaded data makes testing immediate
3. **Test All Roles**: Each role has unique features and UI
4. **Check Mobile**: Some features look different on mobile vs web
5. **Read the Docs**: FIREBASE_SETUP.md and APP_FEATURES.md have all the details
