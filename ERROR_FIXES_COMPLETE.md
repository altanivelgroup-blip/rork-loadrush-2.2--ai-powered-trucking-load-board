# Error Fixes Summary

## Fixed Errors

### 1. ✅ useTripTrends - Firestore Index Error
**Error:** `The query requires a COLLECTION_GROUP_ASC index for collection trips and field status`

**Root Cause:** 
- The hook was trying to query a collection group with a `where` filter on the `status` field
- Firestore requires a composite index for collection group queries with filters

**Fix:**
- Removed the `where('status', '==', 'completed')` filter from the Firestore query
- Now fetches all trips and filters on the client side: `trips.filter((t) => t.status === 'completed')`
- Added better error handling with a user-friendly message directing to create the index if needed
- Simplified the fallback logic

**File:** `hooks/useTripTrends.ts`

**Note:** If you want to use server-side filtering, you need to create the Firestore index by clicking the link in the error message.

### 2. ✅ useDriverNavigation - Maximum Update Depth Exceeded
**Error:** `Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render.`

**Root Cause:**
- The `useEffect` that sets up route auto-refresh had `currentLocation` in its dependency array
- `currentLocation` changes frequently (every 5 seconds from GPS updates)
- This caused the effect to re-run constantly, creating new intervals and calling `getRoute` repeatedly
- `getRoute` was also in the dependency array, creating a circular dependency loop

**Fix:**
- Created a `currentLocationRef` to store the current location value
- Removed `currentLocation` from the useEffect dependency array
- The interval now reads from `currentLocationRef.current` instead of the closure variable
- This prevents the effect from re-running when location updates
- The route refresh interval is now only recreated when `destination` changes or `getRoute` is redefined

**File:** `hooks/useDriverNavigation.ts`

### 3. ✅ useDriverRoute - Request Timeout
**Error:** `[useDriverRoute] Fetch error (attempt 1/1): Request timeout`

**Root Cause:**
- The timeout was set to 30 seconds, which was too short for some route calculations
- The retry logic was disabled (MAX_RETRIES = 0)
- Multiple simultaneous requests could overwhelm the backend

**Fix:**
- Increased timeout from 30 seconds to 45 seconds (`REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS = 45000`)
- Improved the timeout handling by integrating it with the AbortSignal
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios
- Simplified the retry logic (removed retries since they weren't being used)
- Added proper cleanup of timeout when request is aborted

**File:** `hooks/useDriverRoute.ts`

## Testing

After these fixes:

1. **useTripTrends**: Should load without errors. If you see the index error, it will show a user-friendly message instead of crashing.

2. **useDriverNavigation**: No more infinite loops or maximum update depth errors. Location tracking and route updates work smoothly.

3. **useDriverRoute**: Route calculations should complete successfully with the extended timeout. Better error handling for network issues.

## Additional Notes

### Firestore Index Creation
If you want optimal performance for trip trends, create the Firestore index:
1. Open the Firebase Console
2. Go to Firestore Database → Indexes
3. Click the link in the console error message (if it appears)
4. Or manually create a collection group index for:
   - Collection ID: `trips`
   - Fields: `status` (Ascending)

### Performance Considerations
- Client-side filtering in `useTripTrends` is fine for small to medium datasets
- For large datasets (10,000+ trips), consider creating the Firestore index
- The route refresh interval (15 seconds) balances accuracy with API usage

### Monitoring
Watch the console for these success messages:
- `[useTripTrends] Calculated weekly trends:`
- `[useDriverNavigation] Route fetched successfully:`
- `[useDriverRoute] Route fetched successfully`
