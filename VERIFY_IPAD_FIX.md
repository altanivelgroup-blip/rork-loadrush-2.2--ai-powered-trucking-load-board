# Quick Verification Steps for iPad Fix

## 🎯 30-Second Test

### 1. Open App on iPad
- Launch Expo Go
- Scan QR code

### 2. Tap Quick Access
- Tap green "Driver" button
- Should see dashboard immediately

### 3. Check These 3 Things
✅ **No auth error** - No alert about invalid credentials  
✅ **Dashboard loads** - See content, not black screen  
✅ **Fuel price appears** - Shows within 10 seconds  

## ✅ Success = All 3 Pass

If all 3 pass, the fix is working! 🎉

## ❌ If Any Fail

Check console logs and see `IPAD_QUICK_ACCESS_FIX.md` for detailed troubleshooting.

## 📱 Quick Console Check

Look for these in console:
```
✅ Quick Access: Driver bypass engaged
ℹ️ [tRPC] No Firebase user (bypass mode)
✅ [tRPC] Response received: 200 OK
```

## 🔥 What Changed

1. **Quick access = instant bypass** (no Firebase auth)
2. **Auth token has timeout** (won't hang)
3. **Fuel prices cached** (instant display)

That's it! Test now on iPad. 🚀
