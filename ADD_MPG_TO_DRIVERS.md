# Add MPG to Driver Profiles - Complete Guide

## What This Does

This update adds realistic MPG (Miles Per Gallon) values to each test driver profile in Firestore. Once updated, the analytics dashboard will show **live data** based on each driver's actual MPG from their profile.

## Why This Matters

Currently, the driver analytics shows dummy/static MPG values. With this update:

1. ‚úÖ **Each driver has their own realistic MPG** (ranging from 6.1 to 7.9 MPG - typical for semi-trucks)
2. ‚úÖ **Dashboard shows live data** from driver profiles
3. ‚úÖ **Analytics calculations use real values** (fuel costs, efficiency, etc.)
4. ‚úÖ **No duplicate data entry** - MPG is part of the driver profile

## MPG Values Added

All 25 test drivers now have MPG values:

| Driver ID | Name | MPG | Status |
|-----------|------|-----|--------|
| DRV-030 | Noah Jenkins | 6.8 | Pickup |
| DRV-031 | Mia Carter | 7.2 | In Transit |
| DRV-032 | Ethan Price | 6.5 | Accomplished |
| DRV-033 | Harper Rivera | 7.1 | Breakdown |
| DRV-034 | Liam Torres | 6.9 | Pickup |
| DRV-035 | Olivia Brooks | 7.4 | In Transit |
| DRV-036 | Lucas Gray | 6.6 | Accomplished |
| DRV-037 | Ava Reed | 7.0 | Pickup |
| DRV-038 | Mason Kelly | 6.7 | In Transit |
| DRV-039 | Isabella Cox | 7.3 | Breakdown |
| DRV-040 | James Howard | 6.4 | Pickup |
| DRV-041 | Sophia Ward | 7.5 | In Transit |
| DRV-042 | Benjamin Torres | 6.3 | Accomplished |
| DRV-043 | Charlotte Peterson | 7.6 | Pickup |
| DRV-044 | Alexander Bailey | 6.2 | In Transit |
| DRV-045 | Amelia Cooper | 7.8 | Accomplished |
| DRV-046 | Daniel Richardson | 6.1 | Breakdown |
| DRV-047 | Evelyn Cox | 7.7 | Pickup |
| DRV-048 | Matthew Howard | 6.9 | In Transit |
| DRV-049 | Abigail Ward | 7.1 | Accomplished |
| DRV-050 | Joseph Torres | 6.5 | Pickup |
| DRV-051 | Emily Peterson | 7.9 | In Transit |
| DRV-052 | Michael Bailey | 6.8 | Accomplished |
| DRV-053 | Elizabeth Cooper | 7.4 | Breakdown |
| DRV-054 | David Richardson | 6.6 | Pickup |

**MPG Range:** 6.1 - 7.9 MPG  
**Average:** ~7.0 MPG (realistic for Class 8 semi-trucks)

## How to Run the Update

### Step 1: Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x scripts/run-update-driver-mpg.sh
```

### Step 2: Run the update script
```bash
./scripts/run-update-driver-mpg.sh
```

## What Happens

1. Script reads all 25 driver profiles from the enhanced data
2. Updates each driver document in Firestore with their `avgMPG` value
3. Shows progress for each driver
4. Displays summary statistics

## Expected Output

```
üöÄ Starting MPG update for all driver profiles...

‚úÖ Updated Noah Jenkins (DRV-030): MPG = 6.8
‚úÖ Updated Mia Carter (DRV-031): MPG = 7.2
‚úÖ Updated Ethan Price (DRV-032): MPG = 6.5
...

============================================================
üìä MPG UPDATE SUMMARY
============================================================
‚úÖ Successfully updated: 25
‚ùå Errors: 0
üìà Total drivers processed: 25

‚ú® MPG update complete!

üì¶ Total drivers in Firestore: 25
üéØ Drivers with MPG: 25
üìä MPG Stats: Min=6.1, Max=7.9, Avg=7.0
```

## Where MPG Shows Up

After running the update, MPG values will be displayed in:

### 1. Driver Dashboard
- **Performance Overview** section
- **Avg MPG** card shows the driver's actual MPG from their profile

### 2. Driver Analytics Page
- **Fuel & Efficiency** section
- Shows real-time MPG from driver profile
- Used in fuel cost calculations
- Used in estimated range calculations

### 3. Load Analytics
- When drivers view load details
- MPG is used to calculate:
  - Fuel needed for the trip
  - Estimated fuel cost
  - Net profit after fuel costs

## Database Structure

The MPG value is stored in the driver document:

```typescript
// Firestore: drivers/{driverId}
{
  driverId: "DRV-030",
  name: "Noah Jenkins",
  email: "noah.jenkins@example.com",
  avgMPG: 6.8,  // ‚Üê NEW FIELD
  status: "active",
  completedLoads: 47,
  totalLoads: 52,
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Verification

After running the script, you can verify the updates by:

1. **Check Firestore Console**
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore
   - Navigate to `drivers` collection
   - Click any driver document
   - Verify `avgMPG` field exists

2. **Test in App**
   - Sign in as a driver (any test driver)
   - Go to Dashboard
   - Check "Avg MPG" in Performance Overview
   - Go to Analytics ‚Üí Fuel & Efficiency section
   - Verify MPG value matches the driver's assigned value

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `scripts/drivers-data-v4-enhanced.ts` - Added avgMPG to interface and all driver records
- `scripts/update-driver-mpg.ts` - New script to update Firestore
- `scripts/run-update-driver-mpg.sh` - Bash script to run the update

### Firestore Update
```typescript
await updateDoc(driverDocRef, {
  avgMPG: driver.avgMPG,
});
```

### Dashboard Integration
The dashboard already pulls MPG from driver profiles:
```typescript
// app/(driver)/dashboard.tsx (line 209)
<AnalyticsCard
  title="Avg MPG"
  value={(firestoreProfile?.avgMPG ?? analytics.avgMpg).toFixed(1)}
  icon={<Fuel size={18} color={Colors.light.accent} />}
  color={Colors.light.accent}
/>
```

## Troubleshooting

### If script fails:
1. Check `.env` file has correct Firebase credentials
2. Verify Firebase permissions
3. Check console for specific error messages

### If MPG doesn't show in app:
1. Clear app cache and reload
2. Sign out and sign back in
3. Check Firestore Console to verify data was updated

### If you see "Driver not found":
- The driver might not exist in Firestore yet
- Run the seed script first: `./scripts/run-seed-command-center-v4.sh`

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Realistic Data** - MPG values match real semi-truck performance  
‚úÖ **Live Analytics** - Dashboard shows actual driver data  
‚úÖ **No Manual Entry** - Drivers don't need to enter MPG separately  
‚úÖ **Accurate Calculations** - Fuel costs and profits calculated correctly  
‚úÖ **Easy Testing** - Each driver has different MPG for varied testing  
‚úÖ **Production Ready** - Structure supports live driver data when deployed

## Next Steps

After running this update:

1. ‚úÖ All 25 test drivers will have MPG values
2. ‚úÖ Dashboard will show live data from profiles
3. ‚úÖ Analytics will calculate based on real MPG
4. ‚úÖ Load details will show accurate fuel costs

When you go live with real drivers:
- Drivers can update their MPG in their profile settings
- MPG can be calculated automatically from trip data
- Admin can update driver MPG from admin panel
