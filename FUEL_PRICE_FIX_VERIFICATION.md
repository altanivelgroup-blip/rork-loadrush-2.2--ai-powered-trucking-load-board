# Fuel Price Fix - Verification Guide

## What Was Fixed

The fuel price fetching issue on the driver dashboard has been resolved with the following improvements:

### 1. **Enhanced Hook (`hooks/useFuelPrices.ts`)**
- ‚úÖ Added intelligent fallback system with state-specific prices
- ‚úÖ Increased retry attempts from 3 to 5 with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ Added `isUsingFallback` flag to indicate when fallback prices are used
- ‚úÖ Improved loading state management (only shows loading on first fetch)
- ‚úÖ Better error logging with detailed context

### 2. **Improved UI (`components/FuelPriceCard.tsx`)**
- ‚úÖ Cleaner display logic - always shows a price (never stuck on "Fetching...")
- ‚úÖ Clear visual indicator when using estimated/fallback prices
- ‚úÖ Better error messaging for users
- ‚úÖ Timestamp only shown when live data is available

### 3. **Backend Enhancements (`backend/trpc/routes/fuel/get-prices/route.ts`)**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging at every step
- ‚úÖ Data source tracking (live_api, state_fallback, national_default, error_fallback)
- ‚úÖ Performance timing logs
- ‚úÖ Better error handling and retry logic

## Fallback Price System

The app now uses a 3-tier fallback system:

1. **Live API Data** (preferred)
   - Fetches from Zyla Labs Fuel API
   - Filtered by state/city if available
   - Retries up to 5 times with exponential backoff

2. **State-Specific Fallback** (if API fails)
   - Illinois: Diesel $3.99, Gas $3.79
   - Texas: Diesel $3.49, Gas $2.99
   - California: Diesel $5.09, Gas $5.39
   - Arizona: Diesel $4.19, Gas $3.99
   - New York: Diesel $4.25, Gas $3.89
   - Florida: Diesel $3.85, Gas $3.39
   - Georgia: Diesel $3.79, Gas $3.19
   - Ohio: Diesel $3.69, Gas $3.09
   - Pennsylvania: Diesel $4.05, Gas $3.75

3. **National Average** (final fallback)
   - Diesel: $3.59
   - Gasoline: $3.45

## How to Test

### On iPad/Web:

1. **Sign in as a driver** (e.g., `driver@loadrush.com`)

2. **Navigate to Driver Dashboard**
   - You should see the "Current Fuel Price (Auto-Updated)" card

3. **Check the display:**
   - ‚úÖ Price should appear immediately (no infinite "Fetching...")
   - ‚úÖ If using fallback, you'll see a yellow banner: "Live data unavailable - showing estimated price"
   - ‚úÖ If live data loads, you'll see "Updated Xm ago" timestamp

4. **Test refresh:**
   - Tap the refresh icon (top right of fuel card)
   - Should show 30s cooldown
   - Watch console logs for detailed fetch information

5. **Check console logs:**
   ```
   ‚õΩ [Fuel API] Request: fuelType=diesel, state=Illinois, city=Chicago
   üîó [Fuel API] URL: https://zylalabs.com/api/...
   üîë [Fuel API] Key configured: Yes
   ‚úÖ [Fuel API] Data received, parsing...
   üìä [Fuel API] Found X price records
   üí∞ [Fuel API] Diesel avg from X records: $X.XX
   ‚úÖ [Fuel API] Response ready in XXXms (source: live_api)
   ```

### Expected Behavior:

#### Scenario 1: API Works
- Price loads within 1-3 seconds
- Shows actual fuel price for driver's location
- Timestamp shows "Just now" or "Xm ago"
- No warning banner

#### Scenario 2: API Fails (Network/Auth Issue)
- Price appears immediately using fallback
- Yellow banner: "Live data unavailable - showing estimated price"
- Price matches driver's state fallback or national average
- No timestamp shown

#### Scenario 3: Slow API
- Shows "Fetching live prices..." briefly
- Then displays price (live or fallback)
- Retries happen in background (check console)

## Console Log Examples

### Success:
```
[useFuelPrices] ‚úÖ First fetch successful: { fuelType: 'diesel', state: 'Illinois', city: 'Chicago', price: 3.99 }
‚õΩ [Fuel API] Request: fuelType=diesel, state=Illinois, city=Chicago
‚úÖ [Fuel API] Response ready in 1234ms (source: live_api)
```

### Fallback:
```
[useFuelPrices] ‚ö†Ô∏è Query error: Failed to fetch
[useFuelPrices] Using fallback prices for: { state: 'Illinois', city: 'Chicago' }
üîÑ [Fuel API] Using state fallback for Illinois: diesel=3.99, gas=3.79
‚úÖ [Fuel API] Response ready in 567ms (source: state_fallback)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing "Fetching live prices..." forever
**Solution:** Check that the backend is running and tRPC is connected
```bash
# Check backend logs for fuel API requests
# Should see: ‚õΩ [Fuel API] Request: ...
```

### Issue: Shows error instead of fallback price
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen anymore - the hook always returns a price. Check console for errors.

### Issue: Wrong location shown
**Solution:** Verify driver profile has correct `truckInfo.state` and `truckInfo.city` or `homeBase.city`

### Issue: API key errors in console
**Solution:** Verify `.env` file has:
```
FUEL_API_URL=https://zylalabs.com/api/7700/fuel+prices+tracker+api/12475/fuel+costs
FUEL_API_KEY=10482|0Vh5MCrSC1OphlOuderbaNyQQWhTI7lpnpjpghTU
```

## Technical Details

### Retry Strategy:
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: Wait 2s (2^1 * 1000ms)
- Attempt 3: Wait 4s (2^2 * 1000ms)
- Attempt 4: Wait 8s (2^3 * 1000ms)
- Attempt 5: Wait 10s (capped at 10s max)

### Cache Strategy:
- Stale time: 30 minutes (data considered fresh)
- Refetch interval: 10 minutes (auto-refresh)
- Manual refresh: 30s cooldown

### Data Flow:
```
Driver Dashboard
    ‚Üì
useFuelPrices hook
    ‚Üì
tRPC client (with retries)
    ‚Üì
Backend fuel.getPrices route
    ‚Üì
Zyla Labs API (with retries)
    ‚Üì
Fallback system (if needed)
    ‚Üì

```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Fuel price always displays (never stuck loading)
‚úÖ Live prices load when API is available
‚úÖ Fallback prices used gracefully when API fails
‚úÖ Clear visual feedback about data source
‚úÖ No confusing error messages for users
‚úÖ Smooth auto-refresh every 10 minutes
‚úÖ Manual refresh works with cooldown
‚úÖ Console logs provide debugging info

## Next Steps

If everything works:
1. ‚úÖ Fuel prices load correctly
2. ‚úÖ Fallback system works
3. ‚úÖ No breaking changes to other pages

If issues persist:
1. Check backend logs for API errors
2. Verify API key is valid
3. Test with different driver profiles (different states)
4. Check network tab for tRPC requests
