# iPad Auth & tRPC Fix - Complete Solution

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **iPad Sign-In Issues**
- ✅ Added 30-second timeout protection for Firebase auth
- ✅ Implemented fresh token refresh on successful sign-in
- ✅ Added auth token caching (55-minute expiry) to reduce Firebase calls
- ✅ Clear tRPC auth cache after sign-in to force fresh token usage
- ✅ Better error messages for timeout and network issues

### 2. **tRPC Fetch Errors**
- ✅ Increased max retries from 5 to 8 attempts
- ✅ Implemented exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 10s max)
- ✅ Extended request timeout from 45s to 60s
- ✅ Added proper CORS headers and credentials handling
- ✅ Better network error detection (handles iOS-specific errors)
- ✅ Auth token cache invalidation on 401 errors
- ✅ Retry on 500, 429, and 408 status codes

### 3. **Fuel Price API**
- ✅ Increased retries from 3 to 5 attempts
- ✅ Exponential backoff for fuel API calls
- ✅ Better timeout handling (20s per attempt)
- ✅ Always returns data (live or fallback)
- ✅ Clear logging for debugging
- ✅ State-based fallback prices for offline scenarios

## 🧪 Testing Steps for iPad

### **Step 1: Test Sign-In**

1. **Open app on iPad** (scan QR code or use Expo Go)
2. **Sign in with driver account:**
   - Email: `driver@loadrush.com`
   - Password: (your password)
3. **Watch console logs:**
   ```
   🔐 [signIn] Starting sign in for: driver@loadrush.com
   🔐 [signIn] Platform: ios
   🔐 [signIn] Firebase auth successful! UID: xxx
   🔐 [signIn] Getting fresh auth token...
   ✅ [signIn] Auth token refreshed
   🔑 [signIn] Cleared tRPC auth cache for fresh token
   ✅ [signIn] Sign in successful as: driver
   ```

4. **Expected result:**
   - Sign-in completes within 5-10 seconds
   - No timeout errors
   - Dashboard loads successfully

5. **If sign-in takes >30s:**
   - You'll see: "Sign-in is taking too long. Please check your internet connection and try again."
   - This is expected on slow networks

---

### **Step 2: Test tRPC Calls**

1. **After sign-in, watch for tRPC logs:**
   ```
   🔄 [tRPC] Fetch attempt 1/8 to: https://your-api.com/api/trpc/...
   🔑 [tRPC] Auth token attached
   ✅ [tRPC] Response received: 200 OK
   ```

2. **Navigate to different screens:**
   - Driver Dashboard → Loads → Profile
   - Each screen should load without "Failed to fetch" errors

3. **If you see fetch errors:**
   - Check logs for retry attempts:
     ```
     ⚠️ [tRPC] Fetch error (attempt 1/8): Failed to fetch
     ⏳ [tRPC] Waiting 1000ms before retry...
     🔄 [tRPC] Fetch attempt 2/8 to: ...
     ```
   - Should retry up to 8 times with increasing delays

4. **Expected result:**
   - All tRPC calls succeed (eventually, even with retries)
   - No "TRPCClientError" alerts
   - Data loads on all screens

---

### **Step 3: Test Fuel Prices**

1. **On Driver Dashboard, find the Fuel Price Card**
2. **Watch console logs:**
   ```
   [FuelPriceCard] State: { fuelType: 'diesel', price: 3.99, loading: false, isUsingFallback: false }
   ⛽ [Fuel API] Request: fuelType=diesel, state=Illinois
   ✅ [Fuel API] Data received successfully
   💰 [Fuel API] Diesel avg from 15 records: 3.99
   ```

3. **Expected result:**
   - Fuel price displays immediately (may show fallback first)
   - Price updates to live data within 5-10 seconds
   - No "Fetching live..." stuck state
   - If live data fails, shows estimated price with warning banner

4. **Test manual refresh:**
   - Tap the refresh icon
   - Should show 30-second cooldown
   - Price updates after fetch completes

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### **Sign-In Fails on iPad**

**Symptoms:**
- "Failed to sign in" error
- Timeout after 30 seconds
- Network request failed

**Check:**
1. iPad has internet connection
2. Firebase console shows Email/Password auth is enabled
3. Console logs show:
   ```
   🔐 [signIn] Calling Firebase signInWithEmailAndPassword...
   ```
4. If stuck here, it's a Firebase connectivity issue

**Fix:**
- Check Firebase project settings
- Verify API key in `config/firebase.ts`
- Try on different network (WiFi vs cellular)

---

### **tRPC Fetch Errors Persist**

**Symptoms:**
- "Failed to fetch" after 8 retries
- TRPCClientError alerts
- Data doesn't load

**Check:**
1. Backend is running (`bun run dev` or deployed)
2. `EXPO_PUBLIC_RORK_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` is correct
3. Console logs show:
   ```
   ✅ Using configured API base URL: https://your-api.com
   ```
4. Network allows CORS requests

**Fix:**
- Verify backend URL is accessible from iPad
- Check backend logs for incoming requests
- Test API endpoint in browser: `https://your-api.com/api`
- Ensure backend has CORS enabled (already done in `backend/hono.ts`)

---

### **Fuel Prices Stuck on "Fetching live..."**

**Symptoms:**
- Loading spinner never stops
- No price displayed
- Console shows repeated fetch attempts

**Check:**
1. Fuel API key is set in `.env`:
   ```
   FUEL_API_KEY=10482|0Vh5MCrSC1OphlOuderbaNyQQWhTI7lpnpjpghTU
   ```
2. Console logs show:
   ```
   ⛽ [Fuel API] Request: fuelType=diesel
   🔑 [Fuel API] Key configured: Yes
   ```
3. If "Key configured: No", backend can't access `.env`

**Fix:**
- Restart backend after updating `.env`
- Check backend logs for fuel API errors
- Fuel API should fallback to estimated prices if live data fails

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### **Auth Token Management**
- **Before:** Fresh token on every tRPC call (slow)
- **After:** Cached token for 55 minutes (fast)
- **Result:** Faster API calls, less Firebase load

### **Retry Strategy**
- **Before:** 5 retries with fixed 2s delay
- **After:** 8 retries with exponential backoff (1s → 10s)
- **Result:** Better success rate on slow/unstable networks

### **Timeout Handling**
- **Before:** 45s timeout, no sign-in timeout
- **After:** 60s tRPC timeout, 30s sign-in timeout
- **Result:** Better user feedback, no infinite hangs

### **Error Detection**
- **Before:** Generic "Failed to fetch"
- **After:** Detects iOS-specific errors, 401 auth issues
- **Result:** Smarter retries, better debugging

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### **Issue: "Failed to fetch" on first load**
- **Cause:** Cold start, backend warming up
- **Fix:** Automatic retries handle this
- **Workaround:** Wait 5-10 seconds, data will load

### **Issue: Fuel prices show fallback**
- **Cause:** Fuel API rate limit or timeout
- **Fix:** Fallback prices are accurate estimates
- **Workaround:** Refresh after 30 seconds

### **Issue: Sign-in timeout on slow network**
- **Cause:** Firebase auth takes >30s
- **Fix:** User sees clear timeout message
- **Workaround:** Try again on better network
