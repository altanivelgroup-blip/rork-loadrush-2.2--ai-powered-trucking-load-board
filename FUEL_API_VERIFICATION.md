# üîç Fuel API Connection Verification

## Quick Test

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node scripts/verify-fuel-api.js
```

## What This Test Does

1. **Fetches** from: `https://api.fuelpricestracker.com/fuel-costs?fuel_type=diesel`
2. **Sends headers**:
   - `Authorization: Bearer 10482|0Vh5MCrSC1OphlOuderbaNyQQWhTI7lpnpjpghTU`
   - `Content-Type: application/json`
3. **Logs** the response status and first two price entries

## Expected Output (Success)

```
‚úÖ 200 OK ‚Äî Texas $3.79 Diesel, Florida $3.86 Diesel
```

## Expected Output (Failure)

```
‚ùå FAILED: Failed to fetch
```

or

```
‚ùå 401 Unauthorized
```

## What Happens Next

### ‚úÖ If Test Succeeds
Your FuelPriceCard will automatically start receiving real data. The connection is fixed.

### ‚ùå If Test Fails
We'll need to:
1. Check if the API key is valid
2. Try the mirror endpoint
3. Implement a fallback strategy
